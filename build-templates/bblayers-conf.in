# Pull in two optional configuration files to allow the user to override
# component source directories, shared state locations, etc.
#
# webos-global.conf (in the user's home directory) applies overrides to
# all clones of openwebos/build-webos in the user's account.
#
# webos-local.conf resides at the top of the build-webos repo and applies
# overrides on a per-repo basis.
#
# Including both here saves the user remmebering to chain to the local
# file from the global one, avoids them forgetting to do so, and makes
# the existence of a global override file optional.
#
# The location of the shared-state cache can be moved by overriding
# DL_DIR and SSTATE_DIR.
#
# The meta-webos layer can be moved out-of-tree by overriding WEBOS_LAYER.
# Note that running mcf will still clone and checkout a meta-webos directory
# in the root of the repo, but "make" will ignore it and use the overridden
# location for recipes etc. The first time you move a meta-webos layer out of
# tree may invalidate your shared state information, as a result of recloning
# the meta-webos layer.

# NOTE: directory names META_*LAYER are used in scripts/bitbake.bash_completion
